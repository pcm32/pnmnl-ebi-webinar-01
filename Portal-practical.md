# Portal practical

Prepared by Sijin He and Pablo Moreno

## Overview

1.- Access the Phenomenal Portal on https://portal.phenomenal-h2020.eu/. 

2.- The PhenoMeNal Portal consists on three main parts, displayed in this order in the main page: 

 - Cloud Research Environment Deployment
 - App Library
 - Documentation

3.- On the left, under "Test drive our Cloud Research Environment", click on "Galaxy Workflow" button, it will take you to the PhenoMeNal Public Galaxy instance.

4.- Go back to the Portal tab.

## Login and Cloud deployment

5.- Now, to the right, click on "Create Cloud Research Environment" blue button. This will take you to the login page, where our single sign on (SSO) will allow you to register with Google, LinkedIn, Orcid or your academic account (provided is recognized by Elixir).

6.- On the login page, click on the "SSO" button. It will ask you to choose an identity provider, choose one and proceed to authenticate with it. The first time it will ask you to register Elixir, follow this registration process. After that, you might need to open again the Portal URL https://portal.phenomenal-h2020.eu/ and click on "Create Cloud Research Environment" if you had to go through the Elixir registration. This only happens when registering. Alternatively, you might see a Welcome with your name on it, please click "Continue".

7.- Once we login, you should see the ELSI requirements and terms & conditions, which can be viewed by clicking the links. Then, you will need to agree with the terms & conditions as well as with the ELSI requirements for the Portal before you can continue. 

8.- You will now be able to select from the available cloud providers to run a deployment. You will only be able to do this if you have an account with credits on Amazon AWS or Google GCE cloud services currently. 

9.- Deploy on AWS with credentials.

10.- Show Galaxy on a previously deployed instance (this starts the Galaxy demonstration part).
